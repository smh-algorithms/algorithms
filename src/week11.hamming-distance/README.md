## Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note**:

- <code>0 ≤ x, y < 2<sup>31</sup></code>

## Example

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
